# Git Rebase Interactive

You can use `git rebase master -i` to rearrange commits and reword commit messages.
I use this to ensure that my commits are:

* Committed in a logical order
* Squashing multiple commits into a more atomic commit

I had previously used the steps I wrote about for [One Commit per Pull Request](http://ndlib.github.io/practices/one-commit-per-pull-request/).
